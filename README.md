# Ensemble

To gather all the things we share.

## Purpose

There are many things I want to share with @elizabeth-mills. We often talk about
them and it would be a shame if we forgot.

Ensemble is a way for both of us to jot down those things and take note of those
we've already shared in the past.

## Features

### Pie in the Sky

- auto-suggest checking off items that are location-based
